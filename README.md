## Big O Time Complexity
| Big O Complexity | Recommendation | Data Type | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| O(log n) , O(1) | Best | | 
| O(n) | Better | Iterate through a loop once | 
| O(n log n) | Bad | | 
| O(n^2) | Worse (Avoid) | Loop inside a loop | 
| O(2^n), O(n!) | Worst (Must Avoid) | |

## Time Complexity Vs. Space Complexity
| | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Structure | Can be Optimized | Mostly Bad | 
| Algorithms | Mostly Bad | Can be Optimized |


### Factors for Space Complexity
- **Heap** : Memory used by variables
- **Stack** : Tracks of all the function calls
